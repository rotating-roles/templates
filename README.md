# Rotating roles

**Struggling with team engagement and knowledge sharing?** Our rotating roles
system ensures that everyone on the team gets a chance to shine and learn
something new while taking care of daily tasks. These can be:

* handling releases or deployments
* running meetings
* grooming backlog
* keeping production service alive
* interacting with other teams, users and community

These should be a responsibility of the whole team, not just a single person.
With rotating roles, you can have an engaged team that takes turns in the daily
operations and is not disrupted when a key member leaves for a vacation.

This repository is an evolution of the rotating roles that we started in the
Packit team. You can see it in action [here](https://github.com/packit/agile)
and check role assignments in the [repository's
issues](https://github.com/packit/agile/issues).

After the technique proved successful, we followed with a series of blog posts and presentations:

## Common team roles
We have interviewed several colleagues of ours from Red Hat. The conclusion we
reached was there are multiple common roles that apply in many teams. We will
define them here so you can easily reuse the roles in your team. They don‚Äôt
apply everywhere and to everyone ‚Äî  you are welcome to be inspired and create a
role that will fit your team.

## üóìÔ∏èMeeting lead
Having a productive meeting that sticks to agenda, has notes, and a clear
outcome, has a tremendeous impact on everyone. With one responsible meeting
lead, you can stop wasting time of all people on your meetings.

### Responsible for
* Run a meeting (TBD: this could be more detailed)
* Make sure people stay on topic
* Follow meeting agenda - address all points
* Write down action items and assign them
* Make meeting notes or assign someone on the call to write them down

### Why have this role?
* Meetings need moderators, otherwise they succumb to chaos
* Well run meeting is the difference between a complete waste of time and
  effectively coordinating in a group of people

### What can people learn?
* Not everyone likes the attention, so this can be a big step outside of
  comfort zone for many.
* It can be tiring to be in charge of everything all the time. Managers
  understand. Team members may suddenly feel more empathy and compassion once
  they realize that leading a meeting requires significant effort.
* Better knowledge about the code base to be able to review the changes.

## üèÉ Agile lead
As we participate in our agile methodology technique, be it scrum or kanban, we
should have someone to be in charge. This role can be very similar to the
Meeting lead. We are keeping it separate here so we can clearly distinguish
between agile development methodology and just running meetings.

### Responsible for
* The team sticks to all the agile ceremonies as they are defined.
* Coordinate with the meeting lead are be one.
* Make sure everyone has the capacity to work on their tasks.
* Assist people who are struggling in their assignments.
* Volunteer if possible for i.e. research, testing, or reaching out to
different teams if needed.
* Celebrate success with the team.

### Why have this role?
* It could become chaotic without an agile lead.

### What can people learn?
* The responsibility to be in charge of the team's sprint.
* It is an important experience for junior members of the team to be the lead.

## üéôÔ∏èCommunity shepherd
Building community can take a lot of time and energy. It's something we are
often not taught at a school. When users can directly interact with project's
developers, it allows them to quickly address issues and start a lasting
professional relationship.

This role can be paired with the watcher of alerts and monitoring.

### Responsible for
* Pay attention to questions and comments from your community in your chat
rooms, issue trackers, mailing lists, social media.
* Bring user's pain points back to the team and make sure they are prioritized.
* Suggest improvements based on the feedback.
* Lead community meetings.

### Why have this role?
* Your users will stay, when you listen to them.
* Close relationship between project members and users or customers can be a key to success.

### What can people learn?
* See how people use your team's solutions.
* Improve social skills and step out of the comfort zone.
* Expand your professional network and become more visible.

## üî≠ Chief reviewer

Reviews are a pillar of a successful project. They make sure we are not making
obvious mistakes and can be an effective learning tool for all parties. Make
sure that your team is clear who is responsible for driving a proposal towards
end (i.e. merging a pull request): if it's the author, maintainer, manager, or
reviewer.

### Responsible for
* Provide reviews in project‚Äôs git repositories, design documents, email drafts
  or external communication before it‚Äôs sent out.
* If a proposal is unclear, don‚Äôt be afraid to set up a 1:1 time with the
  author of the pull request or a document to be on the same page.
* Try the proposed solution in practice so you can provide hands-on feedback
before it's released.

### Why have this role?
* Reviews can be an unpopular activity. Good review is really hard, takes a lot
  of time and requires empathy so that none of the sides get offended. It's an
  important skill we all should train.
* Good review culture in a project helps you build amazing solutions.
* Collaboration in teams without reviews leads to silos - knowledge and
  expertise will be accumulated in people who make solutions.

### What can people learn?
* Be amazing reviewers. This is immensely important to junior team members.
* Become better coders, analysts, researchers.
* Better knowledge about the code base to be able to review the changes.
